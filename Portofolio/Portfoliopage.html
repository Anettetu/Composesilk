        I have always had a passion for photography, but it wasn't until recently I started exploring all the possibilities of having a camera. 
    </p>

    <p>
        During covid we have been on several trips around in Norway. The first year we went to Lofoten, North in Norway. During the trip we went to several famous places like Ryten, Å and Honnigsvåg. 
    </p>

    <p>
        On the second trip we went many different places, including Loen, Åndalsnes, Geiranger and Lom. We walked the famous walk up Rampestreken and to Raksætra.

        During our trips to Budapest we have been to many different escaperooms. When covid came to Norway, we found ourselves with some spare time, and decided to make our own escaperoom. We took inspiration from the TV-show "La casa de papel". To solve the room you had to solve several different puzzles within an hour.
    </p>

    <p>
        The escaperoom has been completed by 7 different groups. Most of the groups were around 25 years old. The escaperoom was also tried on 4th graders, who at the end of the year mentioned it as one of the best things they had done at school the past year.

        I started knitting a couple years ago by watching Youtube videoes and getting tips from people I knew. I have now knitted in total 6 sweaters with different patterns. Some of them have been for gifts, and others for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have also knitted several other things like socks, vests, mittens and hats.
