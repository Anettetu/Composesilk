<h1>The making of the webpage</h1>

<div class="box">

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<h5>Folders</h5>
    <p> 
      Before I started to write the code I made folders, making it easy to navigate and find the relevant pages and photos when I was coding. I made one folder for all the images, and one folder for each page. If I want to keep developing my webpage later, this will make it easier since it is well organized. 
    </p>

<h5>Semantic tags</h5>
    <p>
        The semantic tags gives meaning to the different content in the webpage. I was aware of the importance of the communication with the browser, and made sure to have an overview of the semantic tags before I started the coding. 
    </p>

<h5>Design elements</h5>
    <p>
        Regards to the design of my page I decided on 4 colors I wanted to use, 2 shades of peach, black and white. I chose the font "Trebuchet MS" which is a web safe font according to w3schools. It works well on  smaller screens such as pc and phones which is what the page is mainly designed for. 
    </p>

<h4>During the coding</h4>
<h5>Validation</h5>
    <p>
    I continioustly checked my code in Nu Html Checker to make sure my code is valid. 
    </p>

<h5>Closing tags</h5>
    <p>
    Even though html 5 doesn't require us to close all tags, I tried to be concistent in closing my tags so that it won't be any issues in any browsers. 
    </p>

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<h5>Semantic tags used</h5>
<p>
    I used several different semantic tags in my document. It helped with the structuring of the webpage. I will address some of them and explain why I chose to use them.
</p>
<p>
    I used <strong>"nav"</strong> to make a section on my page to navigate to my other pages. The nav-tag tells the browser that the purpose of this part is to provide links to other pages. The nav is placed inside the <strong>header</strong> to be placed on top of the page. 
</p>

<p>
    I used <strong>"footer"</strong> to add me as author of the webpage. The footer is placed on the bottom of the page. 
</p>

<p>
    To add my qoute on my homepage, I used <strong>"blockquote"</strong>. This tells the browser that the text is a quote instead of just making a div which doesn't give this information. The text is shown in quotation marks. 
</p>

<p>
    On important words in my text I used the <strong>"strong"</strong> element to highlight the words. 
</p>

<p> 
    The <strong>"p"</strong> tag is probably the one I used the most for structuring my text. The good thing about this tag is that it provides information to the browser, but it also displays the text in separate boxes making the page organized.
